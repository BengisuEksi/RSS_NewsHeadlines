# RSS News Headlines Project

This repository contains a simple RSS reader project built with C# .NET . The purpose of this project is to demonstrate the usage of RSS feeds by fetching and displaying news headlines from three different websites.

## What is RSS?

RSS (Really Simple Syndication) is a web feed format used to publish frequently updated information, such as news articles, blog posts, or videos. It allows users to stay updated on websites by aggregating content into a single place, such as an RSS reader application. The format is XML-based and provides a standardized way to share and consume content.

## Project Overview

This project is a single-form Windows Forms application that allows users to view news headlines from three different Turkish news websites. Each website has a dedicated button, and clicking a button updates the headlines displayed in the listbox on the form.

### How It Works:
- The application retrieves RSS feed data from the selected news websites.
- Parses the XML content of the RSS feed to extract news headlines.
- Displays the extracted headlines in a listbox on the form.

### Technologies Used
- C# .NET (Visual Studio 2022)
- RSS (XML-based feed format)
